---

# All that glitters is not gold

---

# I don't want
## to work in a place that 
## cleans my laundry.

---

## Turning Developers into 
# **spoiled brats**
## since early 2000s!

# I'm 30. What am I looking now?

# Has a clear path of growth as a developer.

^ I don't wanna become a manager

---

# A culture that doesn't promote drinking in the office.

^ And don't get me wrong. I love beer.
^ But there's a time and a place for beer, and there's a time and a place for work.

![fit](img/axiomzen.png)

^ So looking for this kind of things in 2015 I joined Axiom Zen.
^ So how does Axiom Zen promote the things I'm looking for?

---

# Follow the money

^ Where is the money being spent?
^ Is it being spent on all this perks that I discussed?
^ Or is it being spent on other areas? What are those?

---

# Travel to conferences

^ At Axiom Zen we ask for people to go to conferences. We paid for their plane tickets and accomodations.

---

# Speak at conferences

^ We particularly encourage people to speak at these conferences.

---

# Easy access to books, courses, learning material.

---

## Allocate time to
# **study**

^ As a developer you need to be learning constantly
^ I want to work for a company that not only recognizes, but promotes it allocating work time for this.

---

## Chapter 2:
# Projects

---

# Flat hierarchy?

---

# Flat hierarchy 
# is a **lie**

---

# This is what happens

---

# This is informal

---

# If everybody is reponsible
## no one is responsible.

---

# Make it explicit

---

### We don't have managers
# We have **keepers**

^ A manager is a decision making role.
^ A keeper is a safety role.

---

# Transparency & Clarity

---

# Work like you're remote.

---

# Rely on Async tools

---

# Conclusion

---

# We already knew this

--- 

# Let's put it in practice!

---

# Danke sch√∂n üçª
