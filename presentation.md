^ I was reading an ARTICLE.
^ I'm a grown men.
^ But more importantly...

---

## [fit] No increase 
# [fit] in the _**quality**_
## [fit] of the product

---

## [fit] It just makes people 
# [fit] _**stay**_ at work 
# [fit] _**longer**_

---

## [fit] How many hours 
# [fit] you _**worked in something**_

^ And this is not a good way to measure productivity

---

## [fit] How much of something 
# [fit] you _**did in an hour**_

^ A good measure for productivity is

---

# [fit] _**Direct impact**_
# [fit] in the _**quality**_ 
# [fit] of your life/work

---

## [fit] Work in a company 
# [fit] that _**values quality**_

## Chapter two
# **The Project**

---

# [fit] Flat hierarchy?

---

# [fit] Flat hierarchy 
# [fit] is a _**lie**_

^ Natural roles of leadership
^ For experience, knowledge, etc.
^ New employees don't know who to ask.

---

### [fit] This is 
## [fit] _**informal**_ leadership [^3]

[^3]: [Cut the bullshit: organizations with no hierarchy don’t exist](https://medium.com/ouishare-connecting-the-collaborative-economy/cut-the-bullshit-organizations-with-no-hierarchy-dont-exist-f0a845e73a80)

# [fit] Make it _**explicit**_

---

# [fit] What does a 
# [fit] _**manager**_ look like?

^ A manager is usually a decision making role.
^ For us is a safety role.
^ For us is a facilitator, coordinator.
^ That's why we call them keepers

---

# [fit] More structure
## [fit] _**Distributed responsibilities**_

^ That means that is not only the manager role to care for the project. Is everybody that's involved.

---

# [fit] What is _**quality**_?

---

## [fit] Good definition of
# [fit] _**requirements [^4]**_

## [fit] It's hard to form 
# [fit] _**a good team**_
### [fit] If it works, keep doing it!

^ That's why its hard to form good teams.
^ 2 talented developers in a ROOM. 
^ They might LIKE each other or HATE.

---

# [fit] Form projects 
# [fit] around teams
## [fit] _**not the other way around**_

^ A good team will continue being a good team regardless of the project
^ I see a lot of companies doing that

---

# [fit] _**Creating**_
# [fit] good teams

^ So how do we try to create good teams at AZ.

# [fit] Be professional

^ Equally as what happened with my dentist. The professional thing to say is No.
^ If the scope is too big. Say no.
^ If there's not enough time. Say no.

---

> But we really, really need this by Friday
-- Someone, right now.

^ We can change the scope
^ We can add more people, since you have standards.

---

# [fit] In summary...
