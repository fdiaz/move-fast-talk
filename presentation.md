# Be professional

^ Equally as what happened with my dentist. The professional thing to say is No.
^ If the scope is too big. Say no.
^ If there's not enough time. Say no.

> "But we really, really need this by friday"
-- Someone, right now.

^ If the stakes are high, then specially this is the moment to say no. If we really really need this for friday we need to be clear and professional to tell immediately when something is going wrong.
